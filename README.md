Email Confirmation

## Theory
Some applications choose email confirmation as an additional step when signing up a new user.
This allows users to restore forgotten passwords and applications to protect from fake, spam
accounts. The task for this weekâ€™s laboratory work is to create an application that would
perform email confirmation.

## Objectives

__1. Create an application that could register a new user;__
__2. Perform email confirmation (via a one time password / code or via a link);__
__3. Output on the screen whether a user confirmed their email or did not confirm it yet.__
